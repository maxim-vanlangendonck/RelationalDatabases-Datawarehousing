-- 2. As can be seen from the results of the previous question, 
-- when there was a mistake at the beginning, it seems like an awful lot of times 
-- the number of total_cases is calculated wrong
-- Therefor, try to find the rows where the number between total_cases and
-- total_cases of the previous line isn't the number of new_cases
-- If new_cases is NULL, replace new_cases by 0.
-- How often was there a mistake?
