/* Exercise 11
If a record is inserted into the Musical_Preferences table for a specific customer (for example CustomerID =
10007 + StyleID = 5 + PreferenceSeq = 2), then the PreferenceSeq (for example with value 2 and 3) of the
subsequent records should be increased by 1. All records with PreferenceSeq > 3 should be removed.
Is it useful to check whether the new combination of CustomerID and StyleID already exists in the table?
Write testcode for the following examples
CustomerID StyleID PreferenceSeq */
