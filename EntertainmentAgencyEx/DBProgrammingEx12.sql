/* Exercise 12
When a Member is added to an Entertainer, then it must be ensured that the EntPricePerDay is adjusted
accordingly so that the price per member remains the same.
E.g.: Entertainer 1002 now has 2 members and the EntPricePerDay is 120 EUR. If an extra member is added,
the EntPricePerDay should become 180 EUR. */
